# [astroBlog](https://blog.madr.io/)

A simple Astro blog I built from scratch

```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run build
```

Tailwind, RSS, Astro collections, all the good stuff. Uses Tailwind's Markdown solution

## Features

- A simple SVG icon link to the homepage/root-page
	- We all already instinctively navigate back to a website or apps homepage by clicking the the logo. It's redundant to have a "home", or in this case "blog", link. Just click the logo, and you're back on the homepage: the list of all pots
- No about, projects, contact, blog, or any-other page. It's exhausting how every blog is also a landing-page-blog-portfolio-site
	- This is meant to be simple, when you have more then 10 posts, you'll start upgrading it
- It's still powerful. Much like the most powerful blogs, despite being stripped down, this template includes Astro collections, an RSS feed, slugified and tagified posts, Tailwind, and Tailwind Prose for Markdwon
	- it's a great starting point for any blog, no matter how complex it might become
